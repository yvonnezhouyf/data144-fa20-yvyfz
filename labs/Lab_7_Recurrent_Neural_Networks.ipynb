The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure.

        "I tried to do some changes to the parameters for the model like changing the number of memory cells and lengths of training epochs. Like changing the number of memory cells from 150 to 200 makes the valiation test accuracy increased from 0.8957 to 0.9062, which worked pretty well. This is quite obvious as increasing the number of memory cells makes the model more complex, thus it could fit the data better and may be better at catching the underlying relationships in the data. In this way, the validation accuracy increases. \n",
        "Another thing I tried was changing the lengths of training epochs. Like changing the number of memory cells, changing the lengths of training epochs increases the complexity of the model, thus would have a similar result. From trial I can see that this also worked well as the accuracy increased when I changed the lengths of training epochs from 50 to 100. "
